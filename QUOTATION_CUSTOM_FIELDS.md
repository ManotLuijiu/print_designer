  Production Issue Status:

  ‚úÖ Currently Working (2 fields):

  - wht_amounts_column_break
  - vat_treatment

  ‚ùå Missing in Production (5 WHT fields):

  - wht_income_type
  - wht_description
  - net_total_after_wht ‚Üê Now properly chains after wht_description
  - net_total_after_wht_in_words
  - wht_note

  ‚ùì Status Unknown (14 other fields):

  - All retention fields, signatures, and other sections

  Key Fix: Removed the problematic estimated_wht_amount field that was breaking the chain. Now
  net_total_after_wht directly follows wht_description, creating a proper field sequence that should
  install correctly in production.

  Total Count: 21 fields (down from 22 after removing estimated_wht_amount)
