# Payment Entry Retention GL Entry Correction Summary

## Issue Identified
The original GL entry logic for retention amounts was treating retention as a liability instead of an asset.

## User's Correct Accounting Logic
**Sales Invoice**: `Dr. Accounts Receivable 100000, Cr. Income 100000`
**Payment Entry (receipt)**: `Dr. Cash or Bank 95000, Dr. Construction Retention 5000, Cr. Accounts Receivable 100000`

## Key Correction Made

### From (Incorrect):
- Field name: `retention_liability_account`
- Account type: Payable (liability)
- GL Entry: Credit retention amount (treating as liability we owe)

### To (Correct):
- Field name: `retention_account` 
- Account type: Asset/Receivable (asset we hold)
- GL Entry: Debit retention amount (treating as asset we hold)

## Files Updated

1. **install_payment_entry_retention_fields.py**:
   - Changed field name from `retention_liability_account` to `retention_account`
   - Updated account type filters from "Payable" to ["Asset", "Receivable"]
   - Fixed function names and descriptions

2. **payment_entry_retention.py**:
   - Updated all field references to use `retention_account`
   - Changed GL entry to debit retention amount instead of credit
   - Updated validation to check for Asset/Receivable account types
   - Fixed all error messages and function documentation

3. **PAYMENT_ENTRY_RETENTION_GUIDE.md**:
   - Updated all references from "liability" to "asset"
   - Corrected field name documentation

## Result
âœ… Retention amounts are now correctly treated as assets we hold (debited)

âœ… Uses existing Company.default_retention_account field
