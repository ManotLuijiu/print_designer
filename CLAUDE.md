## Print Designer Overview

Print Designer is a Frappe application for creating professional print formats using an interactive visual designer. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing complex layouts without coding, with particular strength in Thai language support, digital signatures, and advanced PDF generation.

## Development Setup

## Memories
- The test needs to be run within the Frappe context for checking field installations
- Specific bash commands for checking Thailand Withholding Tax Fields and Item Service Fields:
  ● `bench --site erpnext-dev-server.bunchee.online execute print_designer.commands.install_thailand_wht_fields.check_thailand_wht_fields`
    - Checks Company.thailand_service_business field
    - Checks Company.default_wht_account field
  ● `bench --site erpnext-dev-server.bunchee.online execute print_designer.commands.install_item_service_field.check_item_service_field`
- Add the memory to provide guidance for executing tests within the Frappe context and checking specific field installations

- Add this to memory. Perfect! I found the answer. Here's a summary of how print templates are installed in the print_designer
  app:

  Print Template Installation in Print Designer

  Files Responsible for Template Installation:

  1. print_designer/default_formats.py - Main module that handles print template installation
  2. print_designer/install.py - Calls the installation during app setup
  3. print_designer/hooks.py - Defines the after_install hook
  4. print_designer/default_templates/ - Directory containing default print templates

  Installation Process:

  1. During Print Designer Installation (after_install hook):

  - Located in install.py line 44-68
  - Calls on_print_designer_install() from default_formats.py
  - This installs default formats for all installed apps

  2. Template Storage Structure:

  print_designer/default_templates/
  ├── erpnext/                    # Templates for ERPNext app
  │   ├── sales_invoice_pd_format_v2.json
  │   ├── sales_order_pd_v2.json
  │   ├── payment_entry_form_50_twi.json
  │   ├── delivery_note_qr_approval.json
  │   └── ... (other templates)
  └── payment_entry_thai_tax_invoice.json

  3. Key Functions:

  - on_print_designer_install() (line 27-29 in default_formats.py):
  def on_print_designer_install():
      for app in frappe.get_installed_apps():
          install_default_formats(app=app, load_pd_formats=False)
  - install_default_formats() (line 54-77):
    - Loads print format JSON files from the templates folder
    - Uses import_file_by_path() to import each template
    - Can filter by specific app or load all templates

  4. Template Installation Triggers:

  - When print_designer is installed (via after_install hook)
  - When any new app is installed (if it has print_designer templates)
  - Templates can be provided by any app using the pd_standard_format_folder hook

  5. Hook Configuration:

  - Apps can specify their template folder via pd_standard_format_folder hook
  - Default folder is default_templates if not specified

  How to Add New Templates:

  1. Create JSON files for print formats in print_designer/default_templates/[app_name]/
  2. Templates will be automatically installed when:
    - Print Designer is installed
    - The target app is installed (if print_designer is already installed)

  The system is designed to be flexible - any Frappe app can provide print designer templates that will be
  automatically installed when appropriate.

● I'll create a new print template based on the Thai Withholding Tax Certificate (หนังสือรับรองการหักภาษี ณ
  ที่จ่าย) format from the Revenue Department. Let me use the TodoWrite tool to track this task and then
  create the template.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze the Thai WHT certificate format requirements
     ☐ Create JSON print template structure
     ☐ Add Thai language labels and formatting
     ☐ Configure tax calculation fields
     ☐ Test and save the template

● Now, let me create a new Thai Withholding Tax Certificate print template based on the Revenue Department
  format. First, let me examine an existing Thai tax template for reference:

● Read(apps/print_designer/print_designer/default_templates/erpnext/payment_entry_form_50_twi.json)
  ⎿  Read 35 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me create a new Thai Withholding Tax Certificate template based on the standard format. I'll
  create it as "payment_entry_wht_certificate.json":

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze the Thai WHT certificate format requirements
     ☐ Create JSON print template structure
     ☐ Add Thai language labels and formatting
     ☐ Configure tax calculation fields
     ☐ Test and save the template

● Write(apps/print_designer/print_designer/default_templates/erpnext/payment_entry_wht_certificate.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 35 lines to                                                                              
     apps/print_designer/print_designer/default_templates/erpnext/payment_entry_wht_certificate.json

     … +25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

> ensure it will get install once print_designer install or migrate

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze the Thai WHT certificate format requirements
     ☒ Create JSON print template structure
     ☒ Add Thai language labels and formatting
     ☒ Configure tax calculation fields
     ☐ Test and save the template

● Good point! The template is now created in the correct location (default_templates/erpnext/), which means
   it will automatically be installed when:

  1. Print Designer is installed - via the on_print_designer_install() function
  2. After migration - if the template is new

  However, let me verify and ensure the installation process will pick it up. Let me check if there's a
  specific hook configuration needed:

● Read(apps/print_designer/print_designer/hooks.py)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good! Now let me also check the pd_standard_format_folder hook to ensure it's properly configured:

● Search(pattern: "pd_standard_format_folder", path: "apps/print_designer/print_designer/hooks.py",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The hook is configured correctly. Now let me test the installation to make sure our new template
   will be picked up:

● Bash(bench --site erpnext-dev-server.bunchee.online console << 'EOF'
      import frappe…)
  ⎿ Apps in this namespace:                                                                                
    frappe, erpnext, hrms, payments, translation_tools, thai_business_suite, print_designer, lending, digis
    oft_erp, m_capital, employee_self_service
    … +53 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● Excellent! Now let's manually install the template to test it immediately:

● Bash(bench --site erpnext-dev-server.bunchee.online execute
      print_designer.default_formats.install_default_formats --kwargs "{'app':'print_designer',
      'filter_by':'er…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let's verify the template was installed:

● Bash(bench --site erpnext-dev-server.bunchee.online console << 'EOF'
      import frappe…)
  ⎿ Apps in this namespace:                                                                                
    frappe, erpnext, hrms, payments, translation_tools, thai_business_suite, print_designer, lending, digis
    oft_erp, m_capital, employee_self_service
    … +28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● Perfect! Let me now update the todo list to complete:

## Net Total After WHT Calculation in Quotation

Now I have a clear understanding! Let me analyze how the calculation works and create a similar system for the
`net_total_after_wht` field in **Quotation**. Here's what I learned:

### Update Todos
- ☒ Analyze how `grand_total` calculation works in ERPNext/Frappe        
- ☒ Study existing WHT calculation patterns in `print_designer`
- ☒ Identify the calculation logic for `net_total_after_wht` field
- ☐ Apply similar calculation approach to Quotation `net_total_after_wht`

---

### Key Learning

Perfect! Now I understand how the calculation works. Let me implement the `net_total_after_wht` calculation for
**Quotation** following the same pattern as `grand_total`.

#### 🎯 How `grand_total` Gets Its Value
1. **Server-Side Calculation** – Calculated in `validate()` method during document save  
2. **Document Events** – Uses `hooks.py` `doc_events` to trigger calculations  
3. **Automatic Updates** – Recalculates when underlying values change  
4. **Formula:**  


---

#### 🔧 Current WHT Calculation Pattern
For `net_total_after_wht`, the calculation is:  


This happens in **thai_wht_events.py** inside the function:  
`calculate_wht_preview_on_validate()`.
